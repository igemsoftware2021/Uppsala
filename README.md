# igem_2021_uppsala_qresfep_submission_helper

- setup.py: contains most of the actual code.
- perform_mutagenesis.py: contains the code that performs the mutagenesis with the pymol cli. it is used by setup.py, no need to manual touch it
- evaluate_mutations.py: example file of the code a user has to write to build the environment, prepare the simulations, run and analayze them. running this on an old laptop takes about 2-3 minutes (running this code here, not the actual runtime of the simulations).
