# igem_2021_uppsala_qresfep_submission_helper

the files in this repository were used to achieve a massive decrease in preparation time for simulations that were used to evalue different mutations in our fgf2 protein. the files have the following purpose:
- add_ter.py: some .pdb files did not have a TER (terminator) line to seperate the structure of the fgf2 protein from the receptor that was part of the same file. the script looks for the last amino acid of the fgf2 protein (which has specific data, but not a different line number between files), and adds the TER line below that one (the receptor also supercedes the fgf2 protein in all files)
- shift_3rd_column_pmyol_pdb.py: align the content of the third column of the pdb file input to make it compatible with the simulation software we used, that uses non-standard column alignment for atom types specifically
- align_3rd_column_pymol_pdb.py: same functionality of shift_3rd_column_pmyol_pdb.py, plus an application of a fix for the naming of atoms that pymol produces (where we apply the AA mutations), which are incompatible with the software use for the simulations.
- prepare_*.sh: these very simple script files specify the position of the amino acid that we want to evaluate with that set of simulations, the AA in that position in the wildtype protein, and the AA we want to mutate it to. the script then calls the script that does the actual work with these parameters
- prepare_simulation.sh: setup a set of simulations, where a set again contains 4 sets of 10 simulations each. using the settings from the previous file (passed as arguments), this script aligns the aforementioned third column in the relevant pdb files, and then prepares each set of 10 simulations
- setup_simulations.sh: this file uses the software that offers the simulation functionality (or rather the setup functionality that the software provides) to prepare the actual simulation files that are ready to be submitted to our supercomputer cluster. it keeps the alignment of the 3rd column in the pdb file consistent between steps (each step undoes the alignment), adds the also already mentioned terminator line to relevant files, keeps file naming consistent between uses of the software (where file names have fixed requirements), provides visual feedback for the user who uses this script to verify that everything worked, and changes the resulting file that contains the supercomputer submission code to use some cluster-specific settings that could not be specified elsewhere.
