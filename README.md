# Software Tool - Team Uppsala, iGEM 2021

- evaluate_mutations.py: example file of the code a user has to write to build the environment, prepare the simulations, run and analayze them. running this on an old laptop takes about 2-3 minutes (running this code here, not the actual runtime of the simulations).
- setup.py: contains the bulk of this tool's code, including the functions the user interacts with
- perform_mutagenesis.py: for internal use only!
